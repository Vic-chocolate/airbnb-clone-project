Use Case Diagrams.
Use Case Diagrams are a powerful tool in software engineering for understanding and representing the functionality of a system from the user's perspective. They are part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a standardized general-purpose modeling language in the field of software engineering.
Some Benefits of Use Case diagrams are: Clear Communication: They provide a high-level, easily understandable overview of system functionality, facilitating communication between stakeholders (developers, clients, users, project managers) who may not have a technical background.
Requirements Elicitation and Validation: They help in identifying, clarifying, and validating system requirements by focusing on what the system does for its users. This can uncover missing requirements or discrepancies early in the development cycle.
